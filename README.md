#Bullet Physics and NGL
![alt tag](http://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/GraphicsLib/Demos/BulletTower.png)

Using the Bullet Physics with NGL, the demo has basic wrappers for the Physics world and rigid bodies It then procedurally generates a tower which the user can demolish.

An interactive WebGL demo is [here](http://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/WebGL/BulletTower/)
For more details read the user [guide](http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/) of Bullet.


Note this branch is an older version and will not be maintained as it uses the old OpenGL widget
